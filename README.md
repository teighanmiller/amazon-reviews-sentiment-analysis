# Amazon Reviews Sentiment Analysis  

This project demonstrates a **machine learning pipeline** for classifying Amazon product reviews into **positive** and **negative sentiment**. It showcases my ability to build **end-to-end NLP systems** that handle data ingestion, preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and persistence.

## Project Overview  

E-commerce platforms like Amazon generate massive amounts of customer reviews. Analyzing this feedback manually is impossible at scale. This project automates the process using **logistic regression with bag-of-words features**, providing an interpretable baseline model for sentiment classification.  

The pipeline covers:  
- **Preprocessing** raw text with spaCy (tokenization, lemmatization, stopword & punctuation removal).  
- **Feature engineering** with scikit-learn‚Äôs `CountVectorizer` and `TfidfVectorizer`.  
- **Model training & persistence** with logistic regression.  
- **Evaluation** using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Skills & Tools Demonstrated  

- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: spaCy for text cleaning and efficient batch processing.  
- **Machine Learning**: Logistic regression as a baseline classifier for sentiment analysis.  
- **Feature Extraction**: Compared bag-of-words (`CountVectorizer`) vs. TF-IDF (`TfidfVectorizer`).  
- **Software Engineering Practices**:  
  - Modular class design (`Preprocessing` and `SentimentAnalysis`).  
  - Serialization of models with `pickle`.  
  - Docstrings, comments, and type hints for maintainability.  
- **Data Handling**: Efficient file parsing and label encoding.

## Results  

- Using **CountVectorizer + Logistic Regression**:  
  - **Accuracy**: ~0.888
  - Strong balance of precision and recall across both classes.  

- Using **TF-IDF + Logistic Regression**:  
  - **Accuracy**: ~0.887
  - Slightly lower recall on the positive class.

**Why CountVectorizer performed slightly better**:  
Amazon reviews often include repeated, high-frequency words that strongly indicate sentiment (e.g., *‚Äúgood,‚Äù ‚Äúbad,‚Äù ‚Äúterrible,‚Äù ‚Äúamazing‚Äù*). TF-IDF slightly down-weights these frequent words, which caused a marginal drop in performance. CountVectorizer retains their full influence, giving a tiny edge in this dataset.

## üì¶ Data

The dataset used in this project is the **Amazon Reviews for Sentiment Analysis** dataset, sourced from Kaggle. It contains millions of Amazon customer reviews labeled by sentiment, suitable for training and evaluating sentiment analysis models.

- **Dataset Source**: [Amazon Reviews for Sentiment Analysis on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/bittlingmayer/amazonreviews/data?select=test.ft.txt.bz2)

### Dataset Files

- **train.ft.txt** ‚Äì The training set, used to train the sentiment analysis model.
- **test.ft.txt** ‚Äì The test set, used to evaluate model performance.

### Notes

Due to their substantial size, the dataset files are **not included in this repository**. To use the dataset locally, follow these steps:

1. **Download the Data**: Visit the Kaggle dataset page and download both `train.ft.txt.bz2` and `test.ft.txt.bz2`.

2. **Extract the Files**: Decompress the `.bz2` files to obtain `train.ft.txt` and `test.ft.txt`.

3. **Place the Files**: Move the extracted files into the `data/` directory of this repository.

4. **Run the Pipeline**: Once the files are in place, you can execute the preprocessing, training, and prediction scripts as described in this repository.

By following these steps, you'll have the necessary data to replicate the sentiment analysis workflow demonstrated i

## üöÄ How It Works  

1. **Training**  
   - Preprocess training data (`train.ft.txt`).  
   - Fit vectorizer (`CountVectorizer` or `TfidfVectorizer`).  
   - Train logistic regression model.  
   - Save artifacts (`vectorizer.pkl`, `sentiment_model.pkl`).  

2. **Testing / Prediction**  
   - Preprocess test data (`test.ft.txt`).  
   - Load saved model artifacts.  
   - Predict and evaluate sentiment classification.

## Key Takeaways  

- Built an **end-to-end machine learning workflow** from scratch.  
- Applied **NLP techniques** and tested multiple feature extraction strategies.  
- Learned the importance of **choosing the right representation** (CountVectorizer outperformed TF-IDF on this dataset).  
- Designed the system to be easily extensible, including support for:  
  - `TfidfVectorizer`  
  - Deep learning models such as BERT or RoBERTa  
  - Serving via REST API frameworks like Flask or FastAPI
